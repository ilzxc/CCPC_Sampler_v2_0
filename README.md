a lightweight sampler in max/msp (currently being revised)


### note

to facilitate a number of revisions necessary to update the sampler with new features (specifically, to support multi-timbral maps w/ per-sample velocity regions & velocity remappings), current work is split into two max subfolders - `laciguena` will remain untouched until new features have been tested enough.

also, because max projects like to move text files around without asking, tests & tools are now sitting outside of both projects.
